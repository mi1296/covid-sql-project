# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This repository contains code for exploring COVID-19 data using SQL. The code showcases various SQL techniques and functionalities to gain insights and perform analysis on COVID-19 related data. 

The COVID-19 data exploration code in this repository leverages the following SQL techniques:

- **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables to analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data collectively.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Utilizing CTEs to create temporary result sets for complex queries and improving code readability.
- **Temp Tables:** Using temporary tables to store intermediate results and facilitate further analysis.
- **Window Functions:** Employing window functions to perform rolling calculations and obtain cumulative values over a specific window or partition.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Utilizing aggregate functions like `SUM`, `MAX`, and `COUNT` to calculate total cases, total deaths, and other statistics.
- **Creating Views:** Creating views to store reusable queries and simplify complex data retrieval operations.
- **Converting Data Types:** Handling data type conversions to ensure compatibility and accurate calculations.
